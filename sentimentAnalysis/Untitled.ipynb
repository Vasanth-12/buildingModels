       " '\"My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on.

But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects.

I was skeptical going on birth control to fix my ongoing acne battle especially since I am not sexually active. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI have been on it for 3 months now and I am so grateful I did this!! My acne has cleared up 80% and I expect it to be closer to 95% for the next pack. It was hard to be patient those 3 months of wondering if it would work, but it did and I&#039;m soo happy about it. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nAt first, I noticed some swelling and tenderness in the chest, but that subsided after about 2-3 weeks, once my body got a bit more used to it.

I can&#039;t say if it actually helped with symptoms because I still have side and belly pain after 7 days of being on it. Just because one person might have one side effect or allergic reaction doesn&#039;t mean the next person will.

I was given Geodon at the lowest dose for about two weeks. I was okay, but experiencing a bit of random anxiety. Then my dose was upped and I had a panic attack (I&#039;ve only had 3 of those in my life before) within 24hrs. Several days later I was in the ER with suicidal thoughts for the first time in 20 years. As far as general effectiveness goes before the dosage increase sent everything haywire, I got depressed right away once totally off the Lithium, so it wasn&#039;t really helping anyway. The suicidal thoughts and anxiety were gone within 48hrs after I stopped taking it.\"',\n",

What I like about Depo Provera is that it&#039;s a shot I have to get every 3 months - it&#039;s GREAT not having to worry about birth control in-between shots. I don&#039;t have to swallow or insert anything or worry about not taking it on time.  For me, it also stops periods which is the number 2 reason I love it, the number 1 reason being that it&#039;s very effective at preventing pregnancy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI got my first Depo Provera shot when I was 14 to stop periods.  I kept bleeding and spotting and was told that would eventually go away by the 2&#039;nd or 3&#039;rd shot.  That didn&#039;t bother me.  \"',\n",

I was put on Nuvigil and a few hours after taking the first pill, I began to feel jittery.  It lasted a couple of hours and as that feeling left, I got migraines.  The migraines lasted for 2 days.  I then had 2 days where I felt absolutely awesome - I slept fine at night and had ample energy to get through my day. The next 2 days, I felt tired and dragging again.  The last day, I was tired, depressed, and crying on and off all day.  I am now off the medication.\"',\n",

You can train yourself to overcome the sexual side effects, and weight gain can be controlled through proper exercise and diet. I&#039;m not an active person, but have to remind myself to hit the gym several times a week. Doing so will greatly and positively affect your mood as well, so just pretend like you have no choice and GO. Also please remember there is no &quot;magic pill&quot; we have to take responsibility for our own happiness, which includes lots more than just taking antidepressants! Hope this helps some!\"',\n",

I have to say Suprep was great! Follow doctor/kit instructions exactly. Works within 30-45 min after dosing. Done using bathroom within 3-3 1/2 hours. Tips: Eat lightly 2 or so days prior, eating mainly soft foods. Hydrate yourself several days prior also, making sure to get lots of extra fluids/electrolytes. Don&#039;t drink too much right before dosing so that you can get all the solution/water down comfortably. Do drink as much fluid as you can in between doses to stay hydrated. And RELAX! Positive attitude goes along way! I would definitely use this product again.\"',\n",

Although generic does not last as long as the Opana brand, taking 3 X per day (every 8 hours) works very well. Rarely do I have the level of pain I used to while taking other medicines.

The itching is horrible.  3 days after 50mg increase I have all the above side effects plus sweats, chills and flu like symptoms. Have extremely strange dreams and nightmares.

My heart would race, my body would get tingles and I would feel chokingness. It was scary and still is.

I&#039;ll consider myself lucky, but so far I have found that Macrobid is actually quite tolerable. I&#039;ve been a bit more tired and achy than usual and had some mild nausea, but nothing too severe. I have found that taking with a full meal is critical and drinking TONS of fluid (water/Gatorade) helps with side effects. But for me this is really a reminder to take reviews with a grain of salt - you really have no idea how your body will react until you try it yourself.\"',\n",

We tried Intuniv because his ODD and impulsivity was leading to threats of suspending him from school.  After 2 days we realized his BP was lower (too low), but he didn&#039;t pass out.  After 2 weeks, his reacting to people was no longer on the calm side, he was emotional about everything, more impulsive and more defiant, not him at all.  We decided to take him off.  At least we can say that we tried, but it just did not work for my son, but it may for others.\"',\n",

I literally felt like it grew me up. it helps so much with bi polar disorder! \\r\\r\\nI used to walk down the street and wonder what passing cars thought about me and wondered if they thought I walked silly. Weird but true. After a month on this medication my life changed. I was more focused my mood swings were not so sever if any at all (I used to have mood swings that would last four and sometimes six months at a time). \\r\\r\\nThis medicine changed my life and I feel as though the effects were life changing!

Although I haven&#039;t had a seizure ever since I began to take the medication (which is good because the meds are working) the side effects were horrible.

During this time I have tried every sort of pain relief available to me, mainly narcotic drugs which I found as bad as the pain itself. Earlier this year I was prescribed Lyrica as far as pain relief goes...fantastic. After a few months (1x 75mg cap per day) I experienced total confusion and was unable to perform my daily tasks at work or at home. I was becoming agitated and experienced suicidal thoughts. Things returned to normal after a week or so of not taking Lyrica. Because it worked so well I am tempted to give it another go. It was just so good to not feel the pain anymore.\"',\n",

Makes me feel much more confident, much less socially anxious, and more able to be assertive, and have no fatigue. AND I am interested in things again. I feel joy from looking at the mountains and such. It started increasing my facial twitches from SAM-E which also Ritalin brought out. SJW feels kind of like a drug like Ritalin but with a much lower up. I&#039;ve got to say I feel pretty good taking it. I take 350mg once in the morning, a double dose at 2:00, and a single dose again around 6:00. Sometimes I will take another dose around 10:00 p.m. I feel like I don&#039;t need the SAM-E anymore.
